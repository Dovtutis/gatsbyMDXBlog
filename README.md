# About the project

I am working with Gatsby online course and this is my second study project. Gatsby MDX blog is a blog webpage where all posts are written in MDX. MDX has no runtime so all compilation occurs during the build stage. It also allows us to intercept the components and make changes if needed.

Key features/technologies used in project:

1. React
2. Gatsby
3. GraphQL and GraphiQL
4. Gatsby MDX plugin with MDX provider
6. Various gatsby plugins
7. Dynamic posts and categories pages created by using node js in gatsby-node
8. Prism react rendered
9. Styled components
10. Netlify forms for handling newsletter emails
11. SEO handled with react-helment package
